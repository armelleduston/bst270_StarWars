# BST270: Individual Project 
This is a re-analysis of the first two figures of the  fivethirtyeight article "America’s Favorite ‘Star Wars’ Movies 
(And Least Favorite Characters)"

## Getting Started

### Software
The re-analysis is all contained in one RMarkdown file titled "StarWars_reproduction.Rmd" written in R version 4.4.1. 
The packages used are ggplot2 (3.5.1) and dplyr (1.1.4). It's recommended to use RStudio ("Kousa Dogwood" release)
to run this analysis. 

### Generating the output
To run the analysis, ensure that your coding environment is clear and run all of the code chunks sequentially (or simply
use the "Run all" command). To recreate "StarWars_reproduction.pdf", knit the Rmd file. 

## Additional Information

### Data Dictionary
A data dictionary title "Data_dict.csv" is included with the survey questions and data types linked to each variable in 
the dataset.
